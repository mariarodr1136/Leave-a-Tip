# Leave a Tip! 😂

**A humorous tip-collecting app that ensures you always get the "maximum appreciation!"**

## 📖 Overview
**Leave a Tip!** is a playful project that brings laughter to social gatherings. The idea is simple: when you've done a small favor, whip out the app and let your friends "show their appreciation" by choosing a tip amount. But here’s the twist—while they can pick different tip percentages, only the maximum option works! It’s all in good fun, as there’s no real transaction here. Just sit back and enjoy their reaction!

## ✨ Features
- **Customizable Name and Percentages**: Easily switch out `[Name]` in the code with your own name to make the app feel personal! You can also adjust the tip percentages to any values you like.
- **Choose Your Tip**: Users are presented with options to tip 15%, 25%, and the "maximum appreciation" option of 45%.
- **Maximum Appreciation Only**: The lower options (15% and 25%) don’t work, so they’re “forced” to leave a 45% tip—hilarious, right?
- **For Fun Only**: This app isn’t connected to any payment system, so no real money changes hands. It’s purely for laughs!

## 🎉 How It Works
1. After helping a friend or doing something nice, open the app.
2. Show them the tip options and watch them pick 15% or 25%.
3. When they realize only the 45% option works, it’s bound to get a laugh!
